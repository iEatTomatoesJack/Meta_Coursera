                <p>Hello everyone. My name is Jack Anjel.</p> 
                <p> I am someone who have been someone who have studied coding since I was still at school. I started with C++ in school. And meanwhile I was learning C# and Java at a coding camp.</p>
                <p>Ironically my first job/internship was about web development with python.</p>
                <p>Covid hit, I moved to United Kingdom, insecurityies hit, depression and what not. I have worked now different kind of jobs and have seen how small and big companies how they your the apps that I want to make. I have tought of ways how to improve them, be it the way you use it or its user interface.</p>
                <p>But here am I now. Back to the right path. The path of programming. My mind is clearest it has ever been. My motivation is highest it has ever been. And I am prepering my self to be part of a team that will leave a footprint in the world.</p>
                <p>I may fall, but I will always will stand up. I will take a 100 no and will always wait for that one yes. And I do my best for the work I do.</p>
